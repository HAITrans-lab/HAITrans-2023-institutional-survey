# HAITrans-2023-institutional-survey
The questionnaire used in a survey on the use of technologies in institutional translation, revision and post-editing workflows conducted between November 2022 and June 2023 among informants involved in written translation projects at different types of translating institutions. The results of the survey have been presented at the 2023 Translating and the Computer conference in Luxembourg.

Please note that the survey was set up online in the Limesurvey tool, and that conditions were set to branch the questionnaire in order to display to respondents only those questions relevant to them based on their previous answers. These conditions are not reflected in the questionnaire document.
